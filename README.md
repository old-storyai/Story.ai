A behavior change is happening. Many experts agree that over half of the human interaction with
technology will be voice-driven by 2030. What does that mean for business?
Does voice have a place in the workplace?

The tools and programming languages available for today’s creators share a single fault,
the interfaces require significant translation resulting in steep learning
curves and barriers to entry. The translation problem occurs during creating and,
even more so, while understanding the resulting software. Imagine if you could
talk to a computer, what would that interaction look like? Would you be thinking
of boxes and wires, diagrams, or code? Or would you be communicating your ideas naturally,
as if talking to a colleague? After all, that is how most software is
made today: someone has an idea, shares it with a programmer who translates it into
a computer language. The act of translating is the problem, not the solution.

AI assistance, like Alexa, Siri, and Google Assistant, provides a glimpse into the
future of work. Just like in consumer AI, workplace AI assistance will start simple: query data,
generate simple workflows and automate tasks — all by having a conversation with the computer.
The days of navigating through endless tools, dragging boxes, connecting wires, copy-pasting data,
exporting and importing, or asking developers to translate ideas into computer code will not age well.
Better user experiences: more natural, more human is what the future
of human to computer interface is destined for.

Storyscript is an AI conversational assistant that provides a novel, natural,
intuitive, and powerful experience to create by storytelling. Our blend of AI,
dialog-driven development, no-code, and visualizations provide a path from idea
to creation while being highly readable and easy to understand for all — tackling
several key problems in the software ecosystem: how we learn, create, use and understand technology.

The people at Storyscript don't just create products, we create novel experiences.
We challenge the status quo and push the boundaries of technology forward.
Our close-knit team is eager, highly motivated, and broadly experienced while also
not being deeply influenced by industry group-think that may prevent open minds to
adventure new thoughts. We are the crazy ones that change the world and until then,
we think differently and remain open-minded.
